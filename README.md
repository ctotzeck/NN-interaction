# NN-interaction-sequence data
This repository contains the preprocessed data files used for the parameter calibration in the paper 'Parameter calibration for interacting particle systems driven by neural networks' by Simone GÃ¶ttlich (University of Mannheim) and Claudia Totzeck (University of Wuppertal)

The first number in the name of the sequence data file refers to the camera (1,...,5) the second number is the day and the third number refers to the sequence. For example sequence_data3_1-2.mat is the preprocessed data of the second sequence of the third camera on day 1.
