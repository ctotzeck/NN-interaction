# NN-interaction-sequence data
This repository contains the preprocessed data files used for the parameter calibration in the paper 'Parameter calibration for interacting particle systems driven by neural networks' by Simone GÃ¶ttlich (University of Mannheim) and Claudia Totzeck (University of Wuppertal)

The first number in the name of the sequence data file refers to the camera (1,...,5) the second number is the day and the third number refers to the sequence. For example sequence_data3-1_2.mat is the preprocessed data of the second sequence of the third camera on day one.

When loading the file in matlab, you obtain a cell array with several struct objects, each of these structs contains position and timestamps for the cars involved in that sequence. The data was used to run the parameter calibration in the aforementioned paper.
